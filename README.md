# About Me
Hello and welcome to my GitHub! I'm Alexander, an aspiring cybersecurity professional and a Computer Science/Cybersecurity undergraduate from Eastern Washington University. I'm deeply passionate about cyber threat detection, risk mitigation, and system security. 

# Repositories
Here, you will primarily find two types of content:

CTF Writeups: I enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and love to share my experiences and solutions with the cybersecurity community. In these writeups, you'll find step-by-step breakdowns of how I approach and solve various challenges, showcasing my grasp on topics like network traffic analysis, OWASP Top Ten exploitation, and log analysis.

School Projects: As a student passionate about practical applications of academic knowledge, I have worked on a number of projects as part of my coursework and beyond. An example would be the File Integrity Monitor (FIM) project, a home security solution developed using PowerShell and Python scripting.

# Connect with Me
Beyond GitHub, I'm also active on LinkedIn. Feel free to connect with me there!

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to email me.

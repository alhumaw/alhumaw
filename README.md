Hello and welcome to my GitHub! I'm Alexander, an aspiring cybersecurity professional and a Computer Science/Cybersecurity undergraduate from Eastern Washington University. I'm deeply passionate about cyber threat detection, digital forensics, and system security.

## About Me

I find value in continuous learning and skill enhancement. You'll see evidence of my interests in various aspects of cybersecurity, such as Linux-based infrastructure security, cryptography, and web exploitation. My involvement Capture The Flag (CTF) events, and my academic projects allow me to apply and expand this knowledge in a practical manner

## Repositories

Here, you will primarily find two types of content:

1. **CTF Writeups:** I enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and love to share my experiences and solutions with the cybersecurity community. In these writeups, you'll find step-by-step breakdowns of how I approach and solve various challenges, showcasing my grasp on topics like network traffic analysis, forensics, and log analysis.

2. **School Projects:** As a student passionate about practical applications of academic knowledge, I have worked on a number of projects as part of my coursework and beyond. An example would be the File Integrity Monitor (FIM) project, a home security solution developed using PowerShell and Python scripting.
